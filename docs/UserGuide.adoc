== Introduction

Rolodex is a desktop contact management application for users who prefer working without a mouse to manage their contacts more efficiently.
If you are a businessmen with a list of clients to remember, a teacher who wants to organize their student information, or anyone with a need for contact
management, Rolodex provides you with a way to organize your important contacts in a fast and productive manner.

== Quick Start

This section serves as a tutorial for you to familiarize yourself with the usage of Rolodex.
By following the steps below, getting started with Rolodex should be a fast and smooth process.

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
Rolodex will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `rolodex.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Rolodex.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the GUI in a few seconds as shown below.
+

+
The following picture labels the main components of the application.
+
image::UiLabeled.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command (case insensitive) in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to Rolodex.

[TIP]
The standard format for keying in person details is `PREFIX/PERSON_DETAIL` (e.g. n/John Doe for keying in a name). +
The following table summarizes the prefixes and the corresponding person details they represent. +

[width=30%, cols="2,3"]
|===
| Prefix | Person Detail

| n/ | Name
| p/ | Phone
| e/ | Email
| a/ | Address
| r/ | Remark
| t/ | Tag
|===

For the details of each command, you may refer to the link:#features[Features] section below.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
