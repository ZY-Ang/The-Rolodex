== Project: Rolodex

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/main/jo-lyn.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/jo-lyn.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Keyboard Shortcuts

The table below shows the keyboard shortcuts that are added, with the exception of shortcuts with the behavior `Exit the application`
and `View help window` which came with the original state of the application.

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[leveloffset=2,tag=shortcut]

---

==== Justification

The main objective of Rolodex is to facilitate an efficient way of managing contacts for users with a preference for typing.
Having keyboard shortcuts allows the user to navigate around the application with ease and speed.
This implementation should enable the user to access all parts of the application without using the mouse.

==== Implementation
